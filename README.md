## Factors

This is the first time I've written ruby, so I apologize if I missed some style errors.

### Question 1

I currently have a caching system in my implementation that skips finding factors for values already computed. If it finds a factor it also checks to see if that factor is in the cache and if so adds the (non-duplicate) factors of that factor to the values array of factors so that it can leverage the precomputed factors of factors (since they will all be factors of the original value as well). 

Filesystem?


### Question 2
